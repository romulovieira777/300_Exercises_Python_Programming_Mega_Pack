Exercise No. 217

Consider a simple number compression algorithm that works as follows:

    111155522500 -> '14_53_22_51_02'

The algorithm goes from left to right through the number and returns an object of str type. Each encountered digit is
stored along with the number of times that digit repeats until another digit is encountered in the number. Each such
pair is separated by the '_' character.

A function called compress() is implemented that compresses number as described above.

    from itertools import groupby


    def compress(number):
        result = []
        for key, group in groupby(str(number)):
            result.append((key, str(len(list(group)))))
        result = [''.join(item) for item in result]
        return '_'.join(result)

Implement a function called decompress() that decompresses the expression to a number.

Examples:

    [IN]: decompress('14_53_22_51_02')
    [OUT]: 111155522500

    [IN]: decompress('11_03_51_03')
    [OUT]: 10005000

You just need to implement the function. The  tests run several test cases to validate the solution.
