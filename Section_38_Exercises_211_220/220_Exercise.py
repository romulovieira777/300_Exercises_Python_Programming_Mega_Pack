Exercise No. 220

Consider the problem below. We have an application in which at some point we get a matrix in the form of a string (an
object of the str type). For example, the following string:

    string = ''4 2 7
    1 5 4
    2 6 8''

represents a 3 X 3 matrix. Each row of the matrix is stored on a separate line. Each element of a row is separated from
another element by a space.

It's hard to work with these matrices and perform some additional operations. We will transform such a matrix into
nested lists:

    [[4, 2, 7], [1, 5, 4], [2, 6, 8]]

Part of a class named Matrix implemented:

    class Matrix:
        '''Simple Matrix class.'''

        def __init__(self, string):
            self.matrix = [
                [int(i) for i in row.split()]
                for row in string.splitlines()
            ]

        def __repr__(self):
            return '\n'.join([' '.join([str(i) for i in row]) for row in self.matrix])

Add an implementation of the row() method to the Matrix class that takes the index as an argument and returns the
corresponding row of the matrix.

Example:

    [IN]: m = Matrix('3 4\n5 6\n7 8')
    [IN]: m.row(0)
    [OUT]: [3, 4]

Example:

    [IN]: m = Matrix('3 4\n5 6\n7 8')
    [IN]: m.row(2)
    [OUT]: [7, 8]

You only need to implement the row() method. The tests run several test cases to validate the solution.
