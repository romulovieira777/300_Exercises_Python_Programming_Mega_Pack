Exercise No. 213

Consider the palindromic numbers. A palindromic or symmetric number is a number that does not change when you write its
digits in reverse order.

Some examples of palindromic numbers:

    - 363
    - 2882
    - 29492

A function called is_palindrome() is implemented that checks if the number is palindromic in decimal and binary notation.

Implement a function called calculate() that returns all three-digit palindromic numbers in both decimal and binary
notation. In response, call calculate() function and print the result to the console.

Expected result:

    [313, 585, 717]
