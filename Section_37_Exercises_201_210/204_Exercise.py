Exercise No. 204

Consider the Fibonacci sequence. It is a sequence of natural numbers defined recursively as follows:

    - the first element of the sequence is 0
    - the second element of the sequence is 1
    - each next element of the sequence is the sum of the previous two elements

The beginning of the Fibonacci sequence:

    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...

Find the sum of all even elements of the Fibonacci sequence with values less than 1,000,000 (1 million).

Present the solution in the form of a function called calculate(). In response, call calculate() function and print the
result to the console.

Expected result:
