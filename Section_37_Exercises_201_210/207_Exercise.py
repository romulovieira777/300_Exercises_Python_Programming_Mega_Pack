Exercise No. 207

Consider the palindromic numbers. A palindromic or symmetric number is a number that does not change when you write its
digits in reverse order.

Some examples of palindromic numbers:

    - 363
    - 2882
    - 29492

Implement a function that returns the number of all-three-digit palindromic numbers.

Present the solution in the form of a function called calculate(). In response, call calculate() function and print the
result to the console.

Expected result:

    90

    numbers = []
    for i in range(100, 1000):
        if str(i) == str(i)[::-1]:
            numbers.append(i)
