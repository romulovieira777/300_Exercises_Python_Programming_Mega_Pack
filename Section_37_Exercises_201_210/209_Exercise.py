Exercise No. 209

Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two integers - this is the largest natural number that divides both of these numbers
without a remainder.

For example, for numbers 32 and 48, the greatest common divisor is 16, which we can write GCD(32, 48) = 16.

Implement a function called greatest_common_divisor() that determines the greatest common divisor of two numbers.

Example:

    [IN]: greatest_common_divisor(32, 48)
    [OUT]: 16

You just need to implement the function. The tests run several test cases to validate the solution.

def greatest_common_divisor(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a


print(greatest_common_divisor(32, 48))
