Exercise No. 206

In number theory, integer factorization is the decomposition of a composite number into a product of smaller integers.
If these factors are further restricted to prime numbers, the process is called prime factorization.

Examples of prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, ...

Reminder: The number 1 is no a prime number.

A number that is greater than 1 and is not prime is called a composite number.

Examples of composite numbers: 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 15, 16, ...

We can break down a composite number into prime factors. For example:

    - 15 = 3 * 5
    - 36 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 3

The largest prime factor for 15 is 5, and for 36 is 3.

Using the previous exercise, implement a function that takes a natural number as an argument and returns the greatest
prime factor of that number. Present the solution in the form of a function called calculate().

Example:

    [IN]: calculate(13195)
    [OUT]: 29

You just need to implement the function. The tests run several test cases to validate the solution.

        else:
            number = number // i
            factors.append(i)
    if number > 1:
        factors.append(number)
    return max(factors)
