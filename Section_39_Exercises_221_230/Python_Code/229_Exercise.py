Exercise No. 229

The exercise includes a file called binary.txt containing numbers in binary system (each number is on a separate line.):

    0111111000100101
    1010111100000010
    0010110000011010
    1111000101111100
    0100101101000110
    0001001000011110
    0000011011010101
    0010100001101000
    0100001100001101
    0001111111000001
    0111101000000100
    1010100010001011
    0010001000011000
    0100010011110110
    0010010011111011

Implement a function called binary_to_int() that reads the included binary.txt file and converts the given numbers to
decimal system. Return the numbers as a list.

Example:

    [IN]: binary_to_int()
    [OUT]: [32293, 44802, 11290, 61820, 19270, 4638, 1749, 10344, 17165, 8129, 31236, 43147, 8728, 17654, 9467]

You just need to implement the binary_to_int() function. The tests run several test cases to validate the solution.
