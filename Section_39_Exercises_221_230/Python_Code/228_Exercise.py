Exercise No. 228

A file called hashtags.txt containing related to sport is attached to the exercise:

    #sport #fitness #training #motivation #gym #sports #workout #fit #football #love #instagood #fitnessmotivation
    #lifestyle #running #like #bodybuilding #healthy #instagram #health #soccer #follow #crossfit #photography #bhfyp
    #run #nature #fun #healthylifestyle #muscle #bhfyp #fashion #fitfam #gymlife #photooftheday #team #personaltrainer
    #nike #picoftheday #exercise #mma #sportlife #boxing #athlete #bike #basketball #happy #deporte #gymmotivation
    #strong #cycling #yoga #style #ufc #sportmotivation #fitnessgirl #calcio #instafit

Implement a function called clean_hashtags() that takes three arguments:

    - input_file - filename containing hashtags
    - output_file - filename to which the hashtags should be saved
    - length - the maximum length of the hashtag

The '#' sign is not included in the length of the hashtag. For example, the hashtag '#gym' has a length of 3.

The clean_hashtags() function loads a file called input_file and does some hashtag cleanup. The function extracts
hashtags up to length characters long and also removes duplicates. It then saves the alphabetically sorted hashtags to a
file called output_file, saving each hashtag in a new line.

Example:

    [IN]: clean_hashtags('hashtags.txt', 'clean.txt', 5)

The contents of the clean.txt file after calling the function:

    #bhfyp
    #bike
    #fit
    #fun
    #gym
    #happy
    #like
    #love
    #mma
    #nike
    #run
    #sport
    #style
    #team
    #ufc
    #yoga

You just need to implement the clean_hashtags() function. The tests run several test cases to validate the solution.

def clean_hashtags(input_file, output_file, length):
    # Read hashtags
    with open(input_file, 'r') as file:
        content = file.read()

    # Process hashtags
    hashtags = content.split()
    short_hashtags = [
        hashtag for hashtag in hashtags if len(hashtag) <= length + 1
    ]
    unique_short_hashtags = sorted(set(short_hashtags))

    # Write hashtags to the file
    with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
        for hashtag in unique_short_hashtags:
            file.write(hashtag + '\n')


clean_hashtags('..\Data\hashtags.txt', '../Data/clean.txt', 5)
