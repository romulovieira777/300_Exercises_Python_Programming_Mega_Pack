Exercise No. 223

Let's consider vectors consisting of only ones and zeros. Let us also assume an additional convention for representing
such a vector. For example, a vector:

    u = [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0]

we will present as a sequence:

    '01101010'

For the vectors so defined, we can determine the Hamming distance. The Hamming distance of vectors u and v is the number
of elements where the vectors u and v are different.

Example: The Hamming distance of the vectors '1100100', '1010000' is equal to 3.

A function called hamming_distance() is implemented that returns the Hamming distance of two vectors:

    def hamming_distance(u, v):
        if len(u) != len(v):
            raise ValueError('Both vectors must be the same length.')
        distance = 0
        for i in range(len(u)):
            if u[i] != v[i]:
                distance += 1
        return distance

The weight of the vector u is the Hamming distance of this vector from the zero vector. So in the case of vector
'1001001' its weight is equal to the Hamming distance of vector '1001001' from vector '0000000'.

Implement a function called hamming_weight() that returns the weight of the vector. In the solution, you can use the
hamming_distance() function. It is also worth paying attention to a slightly simpler implementation. The weight of a
vector is equal to the number of ones in the vector.

Example:

    [IN]: hamming_weight('110001010')
    [OUT]: 4

Example:

    [IN]: hamming_weight('110111')
    [OUT]: 5

You only need to implement the hamming_weight() function. The tests run several test cases to validate the solution.
