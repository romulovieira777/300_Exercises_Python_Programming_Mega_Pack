Exercise No. 153

Consider the two-roll of the dice. Create the probability space (omega) and calculate the probability of getting a sum
of squares higher or equal to 45. Use set comprehension. Round the result to two decimal places and print the result to
the console as shown below.

Expected result:

    Probability: 0.22

omega = {(x, y) for x in range(1, 7) for y in range(1, 7)}
a = {(x, y) for x, y in omega if x ** 2 + y ** 2 >= 45}
prob = round(len(a) / len(omega), 2)

print(f'Probability: {prob}')
