A few words from the author

The course mainly consists of exercises and is geared towards hands-on exercises. This is the moment when a novice
programmer can test his skills on real problems.

I encourage you to do the exercises yourself. Make mistakes and fix them. Search technical documentation and forums.
Use services such as Stack Overflow or GitHub. It is an integral part of the programmer's work. The ability to search
for valuable information or solve complex problems is crucial. Critical thinking also. Fortunately, you can learn it.

Good luck, have fun & happy coding! :)
